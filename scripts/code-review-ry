Some of the things that stood out:
A SHA key was documented inline in build-pgroonga 
An outdated code that has comments about the previous issue. I have a feeling just removing it might be better 
Most function names are good but many lack comments above it to give details on what the function does. I suggest adding more description to it to give devs more context. 
The library directory with many of the script methods has script files and python files mixed in. Maybe create two directories to better organize shell scripts and python scripts. 
The zulip_tools.py is a massive collection of functions. I think the tools in here could be split into multiple files to more compartmentalize them. Not enough comments here too to give more context to all of these functions.
I don't know how good of a practice it is but in upgrade-zulip-stage-2 file, for shutdown server function, there are over 10 if, else if statements in sequence. Seems like there is too much branching logic. 
Each of the files should have a description at the comment to describe what the file is for. Only clue is in the file name. 


And here were good things that stood out to me:
Line lengths were pretty readable 
Absolute paths were used so devs would not get confused with file paths
Comment for virtual environment at the top of python files
A lot of error handling to give devs precise info of what went wrong
Good use of date functions to help with localization issues.
